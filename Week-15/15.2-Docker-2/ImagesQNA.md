### Question 1 : 

      Let's say I dockerise my code base and the build command i.e (docker build -t <image_tag> .), now I made some changes in my code base and again re-ran the build command, Now 2 images will be created or the previous image will be updated again? 

### Answer : 

**Docker Images** 

When you re-run the docker build command after making changes to your codebase, Docker will create a new image. The previous image will not be updated or overwritten. Here’s why:

**How Docker Handles Builds** :

1. Layered Architecture:

    - Docker images are built in layers based on the commands in the Dockerfile. Each command in the Dockerfile creates a new layer.

   - Docker caches these layers to speed up subsequent builds.

2. Rebuild Behavior:

   - When you re-run the docker build command, Docker compares each layer to see if it can reuse the cached version. If it detects a change in any step, it invalidates the cache for that step and any steps that come after it.

   - This results in a new image being created with a new unique identifier (SHA).

3. Image Tagging:

   - If you use the same `<image_tag>` in docker build -t `<image_tag>`, the new image will overwrite the tag, but the old image still exists in Docker's image history (unless explicitly deleted using docker rmi).

   - Example:
    a) Before rebuild: `my-image:latest` -> `ImageID1`
    b) After rebuild: `my-image:latest` -> `ImageID2`
    c) `ImageID1` will remain in your system until manually removed.

**Key Takeaways :**

- 2 Images Created: Yes, Docker creates a new image for the updated codebase, but only the new one will be tagged (if using the same tag).

- Old Image Exists: The previous image will still exist unless you clean it up using docker rmi.

### Question 2 : 

      When there is an update in the image i.e a codebase, do the existing container built on the same image will also be automatically updated or we have to create a new container using the newly created image?

### Answer : 

When you update an image (e.g., by rebuilding it after changes to the codebase), existing containers built from the original image will not be automatically updated. Containers are created from a specific version (snapshot) of an image, and they remain tied to that version.

To use the updated image, you will need to manually create a new container based on the new image.

**Key Points :**

1. Containers and Images:

   - Containers are like running instances of an image.

   - When you run a container, it is based on the image at the time of creation.

   - If the image changes (e.g., a new image is built), the running container won't reflect those changes.

2. Automatic Updates:

   - Docker does not automatically update running containers to use the new image.

   - This is because containers are isolated and designed to maintain a consistent state once started.

3. Steps to Use the Updated Image:

   - Stop and remove the existing container:
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
docker rm <container_id>
```

   - Start a new container using the updated image:
```bash
docker run <image_tag>
```

4. Rolling Updates with Docker Compose or Kubernetes:

   - For production environments, tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes are often used to perform rolling updates seamlessly without downtime.

   - Example with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
This will rebuild and recreate the containers using the updated image.

5. Benefits of This Design:

   - Keeps running containers stable and unaffected by image updates.

   - Allows developers and operators to control when updates are applied to running containers.

**Summary :**

You must manually create a new container to use the updated image. Existing containers will not automatically update when the image changes.

### Question 3 : A question from one of the students

      "In volumes example you ran docker run ... created a container added data to the database and you stopped the container but then you again ran docker run, won’t this create a new container and this obviously won’t have data, I was able to see data if I kill and run the same first container with docker start <container_id>."

### Answer : 

1. **Understanding `docker run` and `docker start` :**

   - When you use `docker run`, Docker creates a new container based on the specified image. If you stop the container and run `docker run` again, Docker creates another new container. Each container is isolated and starts fresh unless you've explicitly set up persistent storage (e.g., volumes or bind mounts).

   - When you use `docker start <container_id>`, you are restarting an existing container. Any data that was saved inside this specific container's writable layer will still be there.

2. **Why the new container doesn't have the data :**

   - Containers are ephemeral by design. Data stored inside a container's filesystem (e.g., /var/lib/mysql for a database) is part of the container's writable layer, which is unique to that container. When you stop or delete the container and then create a new one with `docker run`, the new container starts with a clean slate (its own writable layer).

   - If no persistent storage (like Docker volumes) is configured, the data from the previous container is not available to the new one.

3. **Why the old container retains the data with `docker start` :**

   - When you stop a container, its writable layer is not deleted. Restarting the same container using `docker start <container_id>` allows you to resume from where you left off, including any data changes.

4. **How volumes help with data persistence :**

   - Docker volumes are independent of the container lifecycle. When you attach a volume to a container (e.g., using -v /data:/var/lib/mysql), any data written to the volume, persists even if the container is deleted and recreated.

   - In your case, if a volume had been used during `docker run`, you could have started a new container with `docker run` and still accessed the old data.

**Example Workflow to Use Volumes :**

```bash
# Create a container with a volume
docker run -d -v my_data:/var/lib/mysql --name my_db mysql:latest

# Add some data to the database

# Stop and remove the container
docker stop my_db
docker rm my_db

# Create a new container using the same volume
docker run -d -v my_data:/var/lib/mysql --name new_db mysql:latest

# The data will persist because it's stored in the volume
```

**Key Takeaways :**

- Running `docker run` always creates a new container unless you explicitly use persistent storage (volumes).

- Restarting the same container with `docker start` will preserve the data within that container's writable layer.

- Using volumes is the best practice for data that needs to persist across container lifecycles.
