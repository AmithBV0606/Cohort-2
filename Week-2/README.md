# Status Codes

    Here, we are talking about the response status codes. These codes tell us whether an HTTP request has been successfully completed. Let us take a look at the five classes of the codes â€“

    1) Informational Responses: Codes 100 to 199

    2) Successful Responses: Codes 200 to 299

    3) Redirection Messages: Codes 300 to 399

    4) Client Error Responses: Codes 400 to 499

    5) Server Error Responses: Codes 500 to 599

## To see all the status codes : 

### Step 1 : Open your command prompt or shell, and type in the following command:
```bash
node
```
NOTE : You should see the following output, indicating that you are inside the node environment now.
```bash
