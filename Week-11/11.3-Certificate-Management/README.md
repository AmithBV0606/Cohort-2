# Certificate Management

    This is used when you want to host your project in a secure way. Which means having access to port 443 i.e having "https" instead of "http".

    For this to happen we need to get a certificate which is nothing but a Public-Private key pair.

**NOTE :** As you try to create an ssl certificate for your website with certbot, you may not find the "ubuntu" option with "NGINX". So instead of "ubuntu", select "Linux(snap)" and follow the step-by-step instruction on how to get ssl certificate.
